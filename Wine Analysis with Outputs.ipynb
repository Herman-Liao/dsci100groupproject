    "Given the chemical properties (specifically, Flavanoid and Color Intensity) of an unknown wine, is it possible to accurately classify the wine's type?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the Wine Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine). In which different types of wine (Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon), grown in the same region but using different cultivators, are examined.  The different cultivators allow for different chemical constituents of each type of wine, hence, the goal of this project is to see if we can classify types of wine given chemical predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Jonathon Betchels (https://jonathonbechtel.com/blog/2018/02/06/wines/), it’s most likely the three classes of wine in the set: 1, 2, and 3 matches with Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot respectively. This set also contains data on 13 attributes: Alcohol content, Malic Acid, Ash, Magnesium, Total Phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid Phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, Proline. There are 178 different observations of wine samples in this data set."

    "Looking at the matrix plot above (histograms and box plots), it’s apparent the distribution of different wine classes within `flavanoid` and `color` overlaps the least in comparison to other variables. The separation of different classes within a variable makes the classification of wine type clearer as each type would have a more distinct range of values within the variable. Furthermore, in examining the scatter plot of `flavanoid` and `color` it’s evident there is little overplotting of classes' data points, as well as the distribution of different classes are distinct. Hence, we believe `flavanoid` and `color` would be the best predictors for this project."
